# UserBasedThemeOnUWP
Sample app to demonstrate how to use a theme based on type of user using https://pspdfkit.com/guides/windows/customizing-the-interface/css-customization/.

Clicking on **User 1** button simulates a user of type 1 logs into the app. This sets the toolbar color to *Orange*.

Whereas, clicking on **User 2** button simulates a user of type 2 logs into the app. This sets the toolbar color to *Yellow*.
